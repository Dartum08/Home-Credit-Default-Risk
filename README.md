# Home-Credit-Default-Risk

This is part of my practice of exploratory data analysis. This is a kaggle competition(https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) to predict how capable each applicant is of repaying a loan. I have written this code by learning from various kernels made on this competition(https://www.kaggle.com/codename007/home-credit-complete-eda-feature-importance, https://www.kaggle.com/gpreda/home-credit-default-risk-extensive-eda).
